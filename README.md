## Description

This microservice is responsible of all messaging tasks for the Whispr Messenger system

## Installation

The repository uses `just` a custom recipe runner (like `make` in C lang) to provide useful scripts.

Once you have `just` and `docker` installed on your computer you can start the development server with:

```sh
just up dev
```
